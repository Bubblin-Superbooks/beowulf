<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxiii</h4><pre class="  "><code>’MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,  
old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,  
warriors’ heirloom, weapon unmatched,  
\— save only ’twas more than other men  
to bandy-of-battle could bear at all —  
as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.  
Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings’ chieftain,  
bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,  
reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote  
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,  
her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through  
that fated-one’s flesh: to floor she sank.  
Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.  
Then blazed forth light. ’Twas bright within  
as when from the sky there shines unclouded  
heaven’s candle. The hall he scanned. </pre></div> </div>
