with Beowulf over the briny ways,  
an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,  
precious gift; and the price  bade pay  
in gold for him whom Grendel erst  
murdered, — and fain of them more had killed,  
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,

and forethought of mind. How much awaits him  
of lief and of loath, who long time here,  
through days of warfare this world endures!
