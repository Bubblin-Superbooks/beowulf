craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill  
many a mead-bench — men have told me —  
gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.  
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings  
that not ever at all might any man  
that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,  
crush by craft, — unless clasp of fire  
in smoke engulfed it. — Again uprose  
din redoubled. Danes of the North  
with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,  
who from the wall that wailing heard,  
God’s foe sounding his grisly song,  
cry of the conquered, clamorous pain  
from captive of hell. Too closely held him  
he who of men in might was strongest  
in that same day of this our life.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
