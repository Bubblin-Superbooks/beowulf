the Geatish war-prince Grendel’s mother.  
Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,  
his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.  
Swift on her part she paid him back  
with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.  
Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,

broad and brown-edged,  the bairn to avenge,

withstanding entrance of edge or blade.  
Life would have ended for Ecgtheow’s son,  
under wide earth for that earl of Geats,  
had his armor of war not aided him,  
battle-net hard, and holy God </pre></div> </div>
