blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,  
and that wild brood worsted. I’ the waves I slew  
nicors  by night, in need and peril  
avenging the Weders,  whose woe they sought, —  
crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,  
monster cruel, be mine to quell  
in single battle! So, from thee,  
thou sovran of the Shining-Danes,  
Scyldings’-bulwark, a boon I seek, —  
and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,  
O Warriors’-shield, now I’ve wandered far, —  
that I alone with my liegemen here,  
this hardy band, may Heorot purge!  
More I hear, that the monster dire,  
in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;  
hence shall I scorn — so Hygelac stay,  
king of my kindred, kind to me! — </pre></div> </div>
