heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,  
Lord Eternal, for life extended  
that I on this head all hewn and bloody,  
after long evil, with eyes may gaze!  
\— Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,  
warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure  
at dawn of day, be dealt between us!”  
Glad was the Geats’ lord, going betimes  
to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.  
Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,  
for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight  
nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened  
dusk o’er the drinkers.  
The doughty ones rose:  
for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,  
aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,  
shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned. </pre></div> </div>
