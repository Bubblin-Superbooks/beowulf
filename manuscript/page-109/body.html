“Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene  
gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,  
sovran wise, what once was said:  
if in thy cause it came that I  
should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide  
to me, though fallen, in father’s place!  
Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,  
my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;  
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,  
Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!  
Geatland’s king may ken by the gold,  
Hrethel’s son see, when he stares at the treasure,  
that I got me a friend for goodness famed,  
and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.  
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword, </pre></div> </div>
