Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made  
his last of all: “I have lived through many  
wars in my youth; now once again,  
old folk-defender, feud will I seek,  
do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer  
forth from his cavern come to fight me!”  
Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,  
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,  
comrades of war: “I should carry no weapon,  
no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew  
how, with such enemy, else my vows  
I could gain as I did in Grendel’s day.  
But fire in this fight I must fear me now,  
and poisonous breath; so I bring with me  
breastplate and board.  From the barrow’s keeper  
no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end  
our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots, </pre></div> </div>
