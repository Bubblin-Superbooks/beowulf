“Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better  
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.  
Each of us all must his end abide  
in the ways of the world; so win who may  
glory ere death! When his days are told,  
that is the warrior’s worthiest doom.  
Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,  
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.  
No harbor shall hide her — heed my promise! —  
enfolding of field or forested mountain  
or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!  
But thou this day endure in patience,  
as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one.”  
Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,  
mighty Lord, for the man’s brave words. </pre></div> </div>
