the linked harness, with loathsome hand.  
Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,  
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted  
whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,  
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters  
that sore beset him; sea-beasts many  
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,  
and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked

where water never could work him harm,  
nor through the roof could reach him ever  
fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,  
beams of a blaze that brightly shone.  
Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,  
mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke  
he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not. </pre></div> </div>
