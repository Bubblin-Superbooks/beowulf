at wish and word of his wounded king, —  
war-sick warrior, — woven mail-coat,  
battle-sark, bore ’neath the barrow’s roof.  
Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,  
passing the seat,  saw store of jewels  
and glistening gold the ground along;  
by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel  
in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:  
unburnished bowls of bygone men  
reft of richness; rusty helms  
of the olden age; and arm-rings many  
wondrously woven. — Such wealth of gold,  
booty from barrow, can burden with pride  
each human wight: let him hide it who will! —  
His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner </pre></div> </div>
