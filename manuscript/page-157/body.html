fifty winters,  a wise old prince,  
warding his land, until One began  
in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.  
In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,  
in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,  
unknown to mortals. Some man, however,  
came by chance that cave within  
to the heathen hoard.  In hand he took  
a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,  
stole with it away, while the watcher slept,  
by thievish wiles: for the wardenâ€™s wrath  
prince and people must pay betimes!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
