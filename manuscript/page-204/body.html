the living earl by the other dead,  
and heavy of heart a head-watch  keeps  
o’er friend and foe. — Now our folk may look  
for waging of war when once unhidden  
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king  
is spread afar. — The strife began  
when hot on the Hugas  Hygelac fell  
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.  
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,  
plied with such prowess their power o’erwhelming  
that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it  
and fell in fight. To his friends no wise  
could that earl give treasure! And ever since  
the Merowings’ favor has failed us wholly.  
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith  
from Swedish folk. ’Twas spread afar  
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood </pre></div> </div>
