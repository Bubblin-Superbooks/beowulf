for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng  
of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,  
the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings  
that were wove on the wall, and wonders many  
to delight each mortal that looks upon them.  
Though braced within by iron bands,  
that building bright was broken sorely;   
rent were its hinges; the roof alone  
held safe and sound, when, seared with crime,  
the fiendish foe his flight essayed,  
of life despairing. — No light thing that,  
the flight for safety, — essay it who will!  
Forced of fate, he shall find his way  
to the refuge ready for race of man,  
for soul-possessors, and sons of earth; </pre></div> </div>
