She greeted the Geats’ lord, God she thanked,  
in wisdom’s words, that her will was granted,  
that at last on a hero her hope could lean  
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,  
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow’s hand,  
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.  
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: —  
“This was my thought, when my thanes and I  
bent to the ocean and entered our boat,  
that I would work the will of your people  
fully, or fighting fall in death,  
in fiend’s gripe fast. I am firm to do  
an earl’s brave deed, or end the days  
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here.”  
Well these words to the woman seemed,  
Beowulf’s battle-boast. — Bright with gold  
the stately dame by her spouse sat down. </pre></div> </div>
