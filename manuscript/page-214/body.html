who heinously hid, that hall within,  
wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed  
one of a few,  and the feud was avenged  
in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,  
what manner a man of might and valor  
oft ends his life, when the earl no longer  
in mead-hall may live with loving friends.  
So Beowulf, when that barrowâ€™s warden  
he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not  
in what wise he should wend from the world at last.  
For  princes potent, who placed the gold,  
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,  
so that marked with sin the man should be,  
hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,  
racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard. </pre></div> </div>
