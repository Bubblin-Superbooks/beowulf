But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation of the particular case, foretells trouble. Note:</p><p>Play of shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight, and takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son. This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the young princess Freawaru, to her new home when she is Ingeld’s queen. Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out to Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land, escapes. So the old feud must break out again.</p><p>That is, their disastrous battle and the slaying of their king.</p><p>The sword.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Beowulf returns to his forecast.
