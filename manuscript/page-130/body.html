Him wander-weary, warrior-guest  
from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,  
who by custom courtly cared for all  
needs of a thane as in those old days  
warrior-wanderers wont to have.  
So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall  
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on

blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying  
shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,  
athelings all were eager homeward  
forth to fare; and far from thence  
the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.

to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,  
excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,  
quoth that he counted it keen in battle, </pre></div> </div>
