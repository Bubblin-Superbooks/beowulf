“Lo, we seafarers say our will,  
far-come men, that we fain would seek  
Hygelac now. We here have found  
hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.  
If ever on earth I am able to win me  
more of thy love, O lord of men,  
aught anew, than I now have done,  
for work of war I am willing still!  
If it come to me ever across the seas  
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, —  
as they that hate thee erewhile have used, —  
thousands then of thanes I shall bring,  
heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,  
ward of his folk, that, though few his years,  
the lord of the Geats will give me aid </pre></div> </div>
