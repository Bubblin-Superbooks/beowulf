the Bright-Danes’ prince, from Beowulf hearing,  
folk’s good shepherd, such firm resolve.  
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding  
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,  
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,  
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;  
and the high-born lady handed the cup  
first to the East-Danes’ heir and warden,  
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,  
the land’s beloved one. Lustily took he  
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.

Through the hall then went the Helmings’ Lady,  
to younger and older everywhere  
carried the cup, till come the moment  
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,  
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead. </pre></div> </div>
