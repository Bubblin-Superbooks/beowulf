brand or buckler to bear in the fight,  
gold-colored targe: but with gripe alone  
must I front the fiend and fight for life,  
foe against foe. Then faith be his  
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take.  
Fain, I ween, if the fight he win,  
in this hall of gold my Geatish band  
will he fearless eat, — as oft before, —  
my noblest thanes. Nor need’st thou then  
to hide my head;  for his shall I be,  
dyed in gore, if death must take me;  
and my blood-covered body he’ll bear as prey,  
ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely,  
with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen:  
no further for me need’st food prepare!  
To Hygelac send, if Hild  should take me,  
best of war-weeds, warding my breast, </pre></div> </div>
