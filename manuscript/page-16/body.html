march-riever  mighty, in moorland living,  
in fen and fastness; fief of the giants  
the hapless wight a while had kept  
since the Creator his exile doomed.  
On kin of Cain was the killing avenged  
by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.  
Ill fared his feud,  and far was he driven,  
for the slaughterâ€™s sake, from sight of men.  
Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,  
Etins  and elves and evil-spirits,  
as well as the giants that warred with God  
weary while: but their wage was paid them!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
