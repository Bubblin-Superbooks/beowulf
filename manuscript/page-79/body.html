when to play of swords the son of Healfdene  
was fain to fare. Ne’er failed his valor  
in the crush of combat when corpses fell.  
To Beowulf over them both then gave  
the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,  
o’er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.  
Manfully thus the mighty prince,  
hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid  
with steeds and treasures contemned by none  
who is willing to say the sooth aright.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
