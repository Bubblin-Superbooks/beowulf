homestead and house. He had no need  
from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,  
or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, —  
some warrior worse for wage to buy!  
Ever I fought in the front of all,  
sole to the fore; and so shall I fight  
while I bide in life and this blade shall last  
that early and late hath loyal proved  
since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,  
slain by my hand, the Hugas’ champion.  
Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king  
with the booty back, and breast-adornments;  
but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer  
fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,  
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,  
his heart-waves stilled. — The sword-edge now,  
hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive.” </pre></div> </div>
