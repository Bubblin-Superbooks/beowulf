that the earl made known his noble strain,  
craft and keenness and courage enduring.  
Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,  
hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.  
A little lower the loathsome beast  
he smote with sword; his steel drove in  
bright and burnished; that blaze began  
to lose and lessen. At last the king  
wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,  
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,  
and the Weders’-helm smote that worm asunder,  
felled the foe, flung forth its life.  
So had they killed it, kinsmen both,  
athelings twain: thus an earl should be  
in danger’s day! — Of deeds of valor </pre></div> </div>
