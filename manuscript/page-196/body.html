A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise  
for my ashes. ’Twill shine by the shore of the flood,  
to folk of mine memorial fair  
on Hrones Headland high uplifted,  
that ocean-wanderers oft may hail  
Beowulf’s Barrow, as back from far  
they drive their keels o’er the darkling wave.”  
From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,  
valorous king, to his vassal gave it  
with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,  
to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.  
“Thou art end and remnant of all our race  
the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,  
all my line, to the land of doom,  
earls in their glory: I after them go.”  
This word was the last which the wise old man  
harbored in heart ere hot death-waves </pre></div> </div>
