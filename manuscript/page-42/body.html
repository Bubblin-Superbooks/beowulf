treasures olden: oaths he  swore me.  
Sore is my soul to say to any  
of the race of man what ruth for me  
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,  
what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,  
my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them  
into Grendel’s grasp. But God is able  
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn!  
Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank,  
earls o’er the ale-cup, armed men,  
that they would bide in the beer-hall here,  
Grendel’s attack with terror of blades.  
Then was this mead-house at morning tide  
dyed with gore, when the daylight broke,  
all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,  
gory the hall: I had heroes the less,  
doughty dear-ones that death had reft. </pre></div> </div>
