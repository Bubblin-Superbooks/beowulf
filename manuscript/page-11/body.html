ice-flecked, outbound, atheling’s barge:  
there laid they down their darling lord  
on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,   
by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure  
fetched from far was freighted with him.  
No ship have I known so nobly dight

thanes’ huge treasure, than those had done  
who in former time forth had sent him  
sole on the seas, a suckling child.  
High o’er his head they hoist the standard,  
a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,  
gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits, </pre></div> </div>
