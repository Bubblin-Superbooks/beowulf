by that bloody battle the boon had come.  
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger  
Hrothgar’s hall; the hardy and wise one  
had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,  
his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes  
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,  
all their sorrow and ills assuaged,  
their bale of battle borne so long,  
and all the dole they erst endured  
pain a-plenty. — ’Twas proof of this,  
when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,  
arm and shoulder, — all, indeed,  
of Grendel’s gripe, — ’neath the gabled roof.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
