he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,

Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,  
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;  
weaker warriors won the spoil,  
after gripe of battle, from Geatland’s lord,  
and held the death-field.

Beowulf lov’d, these battle-weeds wear,  
a royal treasure, and richly thrive!

counsel in kindness: requital be mine.  
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come  
thou art famed among folk both far and near,  
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean </pre></div> </div>
