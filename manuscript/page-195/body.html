alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,  
weakening fast by the wall of the cave.

he found all bleeding, famous chief  
at the lapse of life. The liegeman again  
plashed him with water, till point of word  
broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,  
sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. —

to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,  
for what I behold, to Heaven’s Lord,  
for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk  
or ever the day of my death be run!

the last of my life, so look ye well  
to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry. </pre></div> </div>
