the heart of the hero of high-born race, —  
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,  
his folk’s sure fortress in fee to hold,  
puts in his power great parts of the earth,  
empire so ample, that end of it  
this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.  
So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him  
illness or age; no evil cares  
shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens  
from ever an enemy: all the world  
wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,  
till all within him obstinate pride  
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,  
the spirit’s sentry; sleep is too fast  
which masters his might, and the murderer nears,  
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
