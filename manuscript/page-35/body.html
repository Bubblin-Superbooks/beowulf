“I knew him of yore in his youthful days;  
his aged father was Ecgtheow named,  
to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat  
his only daughter. Their offspring bold  
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.  
And seamen, too, have said me this, —  
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court,  
thither for thanks, — he has thirty men’s  
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,  
the bold-in-battle. Blessed God  
out of his mercy this man hath sent  
to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,  
against horror of Grendel. I hope to give  
the good youth gold for his gallant thought.  
Be thou in haste, and bid them hither, </pre></div> </div>
