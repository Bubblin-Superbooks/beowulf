no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find  
at all to choose for their chief and king,  
for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt  
thy kinsman’s kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me  
the longer the better, Beowulf loved!

Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,  
sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,  
shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,  
such as once they waged, from war refrain.  
Long as I rule this realm so wide,  
let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold  
each other greet o’er the gannet’s-bath,  
and the ringed-prow bear o’er rolling waves  
tokens of love. I trow my landfolk  
towards friend and foe are firmly joined,  
and honor they keep in the olden way.” </pre></div> </div>
