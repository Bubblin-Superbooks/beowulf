With envy and anger an evil spirit  
endured the dole in his dark abode,

fairest fields enfolded by water,  
set, triumphant, sun and moon  
for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,  
and braided bright the breast of earth  
with limbs and leaves, made life for all

a winsome life, till one began  
to fashion evils, that field of hell.  
Grendel this monster grim was called, </pre></div> </div>
