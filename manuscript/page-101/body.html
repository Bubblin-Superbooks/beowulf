Grendel in days long gone they named him,  
folk of the land; his father they knew not,  
nor any brood that was born to him  
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;  
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,  
fenways fearful, where flows the stream  
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,  
underground flood. Not far is it hence  
in measure of miles that the mere expands,  
and oâ€™er it the frost-bound forest hanging,  
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.  
By night is a wonder weird to see,  
fire on the waters. So wise lived none  
of the sons of men, to search those depths!  
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,  
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,  
long distance driven, his dear life first </pre></div> </div>
