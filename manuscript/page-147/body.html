Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword  
which to the fray thy father carried  
in his final feud, ’neath the fighting-mask,  
dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him  
and wielded the war-place on Withergild’s fall,  
after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?  
Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,  
proud of his treasure, paces this hall,  
joys in the killing, and carries the jewel   
that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!\_  
Thus he urges and eggs him all the time  
with keenest words, till occasion offers  
that Freawaru’s thane, for his father’s deed,  
after bite of brand in his blood must slumber,  
losing his life; but that liegeman flies  
living away, for the land he kens.  
And thus be broken on both their sides </pre></div> </div>
