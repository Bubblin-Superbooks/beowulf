the warrior’s spirit enwound with flesh.  
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow: —  
“Through store of struggles I strove in youth,  
mighty feuds; I mind them all.  
I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,  
friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,  
had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,  
with food and fee, faithful in kinship.  
Ne’er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,  
bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,  
Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.  
For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,  
by kinsman’s deed, was the death-bed strewn,  
when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,  
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,  
missed the mark and his mate shot down,  
one brother the other, with bloody shaft. </pre></div> </div>
