beaker bright. My brave are gone.  
And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,  
shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep  
who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;  
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave  
over bicker of shields the bite of steel  
rust with their bearer. The ringed mail  
fares not far with famous chieftain,  
at side of hero! No harp’s delight,  
no glee-wood’s gladness! No good hawk now  
flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet  
stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death  
the flower of my race have reft away.”  
Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,  
alone, for them all, and unblithe wept  
by day and by night, till death’s fell wave  
o’erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss </pre></div> </div>
