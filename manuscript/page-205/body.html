Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,  
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought  
in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.  
Soon the sage old sire  of Ohtere,  
ancient and awful, gave answering blow;  
the sea-king  he slew, and his spouse redeemed,  
his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,  
mother of Ohtere and Onela.  
Then he followed his foes, who fled before him  
sore beset and stole their way,  
bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.

With his host he besieged there what swords had left,  
the weary and wounded; woes he threatened  
the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:  
some with the morrow his sword should kill,  
some should go to the gallows-tree </pre></div> </div>
