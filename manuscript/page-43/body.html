\— But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,  
hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee.”

Gathered together, the Geatish men  
in the banquet-hall on bench assigned,  
sturdy-spirited, sat them down,  
hardy-hearted. A henchman attended,  
carried the carven cup in hand,  
served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang  
blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,  
no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
