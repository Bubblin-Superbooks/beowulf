and gaze on that hoard ’neath the hoary rock,  
Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,  
sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.  
And fare in haste. I would fain behold  
the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,  
have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down  
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard  
my life and the lordship I long have held.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
