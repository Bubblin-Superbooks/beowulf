<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xiii</h4><pre class="  "><code>MANY at morning, as men have told me,  
warriors gathered the gift-hall round,  
folk-leaders faring from far and near,  
o’er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,  
trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed  
the enemy’s end to any man  
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe  
how the weary-hearted, away from thence,  
baffled in battle and banned, his steps  
death-marked dragged to the devils’ mere.  
Bloody the billows were boiling there,  
turbid the tide of tumbling waves  
horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,  
by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor  
laid forlorn his life adown,  
his heathen soul, and hell received it. </pre></div> </div>
