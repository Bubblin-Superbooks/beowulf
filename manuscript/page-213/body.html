seeking its den; now in death’s sure clutch

eaten with rust, as, on earth’s lap resting,  
a thousand winters they waited there.

of human kind, — save that Heaven’s King,  
God himself, might give whom he would,  
Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, —  
even such a man as seemed to him meet.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
