in arms he fell. Now another comes,  
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,  
faring far in feud of blood:  
so that many a thane shall think, who e’er  
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,  
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low  
that once was willing each wish to please.  
Land-dwellers here  and liegemen mine,  
who house by those parts, I have heard relate  
that such a pair they have sometimes seen,  
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,  
wandering spirits: one of them seemed,  
so far as my folk could fairly judge,  
of womankind; and one, accursed,  
in man’s guise trod the misery-track  
of exile, though huger than human bulk. </pre></div> </div>
